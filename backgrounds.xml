        <li>I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.</li>
        <li>When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.</li>

        <li>A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I'll have my revenge.</li>
        <li>I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it, and I seek to atone for my misdeeds.</li>
